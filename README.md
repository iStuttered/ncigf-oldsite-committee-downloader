NCIGF Committees Downloader
---------------------------
This repository is for downloading and organizing committee files from the old member's site of NCIGF.

The script requires a credentials.py file located in the root directory of the repository. To make the script work, edit credentials_sample.py and fill in the correct login url and credentials. Then rename credentials_sample.py to credentials.py.
